# Competitive Programming Workshop 2019
Refer to [link](http://www.lukesy.net/docs/ieeeunswsb-cpw/) for more details about this tool.

## Is competitive programming for you?
### Who is it for?
EVERYONE who loves problem solving

### Why learn competitive programming (CP)?
* The thrill and fun of solving a problem
* Improve your problem solving skills and learn a bit of programming along the way
* Very useful to survive job interviews at certain tech companies (e.g., Google)
* You may also read this [medium article](https://medium.com/@hellomeets/why-should-we-learn-competitive-coding-d5e21d469134).

Doing competitive programming will definitely reward you with fun, learning, and future rewards. With that said, if this is not your cup of tea, it doesn't mean it is the end of the world (or your programming carreer).

### What's expected from you?
* Passion for problem solving and willingness to learn
* Bring your own computer. 
  * Needless to say, it should be able to connect to the internet.
* (Optional) Knowledge of a programming language. Session 01 will run using Python.
  * We actually don't mind even if you have zero programming experience. However, you must be also willing to run the extra mile to catch up with the cohort. 
* (Warning) The sessions were designed for STEM university students. 
  * 1st years are very welcome to join!
  * You can definitely join even if you are not from STEM.

## Library
* We primarily use [cpbook](https://github.com/stevenhalim/cpbook-code)
  * ch2 ourown contains union find
  * ch4 containts minimum spanning tree (mst) and single source shortest path (sssp)

## Learning Environment
### Regular CP Workshop
* Up to you. We currently use Hackerrank as our training platform which supports c, c++, java, python, and more. [ieee unsw sb 2019 training contest](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/ieee-unsw-sb-xtreme-training-2019/challenges)
* We'd like to acknowledge UVa judge as we use their DB for our private trainings.

### Session 1
We will be using Google Colab for their free python jupyter notebooks. This setup means:
* You don't really need to install anything on your PC
* You will need to have a google account
* Notebooks are on the cloud and will require internet connection to edit and run

To open a notebook from this repository, you can
* Visit [colabs](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true) -> GITHUB tab -> search for "ieeeunswsb"
* Click the collated shortcuts below. Disclaimer: we might forget to update this...
